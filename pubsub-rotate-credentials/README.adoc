## Expiring/rotating credentials example

This example demonstrates refreshing Pub/Sub credentials and dependent beans to re-subscribe without having to restart the application.

How to run this sample:

1. Update `credentials.path` property in `application.properties` file to point to a JSON credentials file with sufficient permissions to subscribe to Pub/Sub.
2. Create a topic with any name and subscription named `sub-one` associated with this topic.
3. Start `SampleApplication`.
4. Send some messages to the topic.
5. In Cloud console's Identity  > Service Accounts section, find the service account you are using and delete the key.
6. Observe error messages either in a few minutes, or immediately after sending another message to the topic.
7. Generate a new JSON key and save it into the same file location, replacing the old invalid key.
8. In a terminal, run `curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/actuator/refresh`.
9. Observe application logs indicating context refresh.
The application will now correctly receive messages again.
