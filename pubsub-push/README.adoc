This sample demonstrates reconnecting a trace span to its parent trace when Pub/Sub push subscriptions are used.

## To run:

1) Start Pub/Sub emulator
```
gcloud beta emulators pubsub start
```

2) Start the application. It will create `pushtopic` and `pushsubscription` in the emulator.
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

3) Do a POST call to the `/sendMessage` endpoint to start the process.
This will publish the message to the Pub/Sub emulator.
```
curl -X POST -d'test message' http://localhost:8080/sendMessage
```

4) Observe the logging message indicating that the push endpoint was invoked by the emulator:
```
 Got message from Pub/Sub push
```

5) Go to Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/traces/list); observe there is a single, unified trace going from `/sendmessage` to `got-message-from-pubsub-push`.
